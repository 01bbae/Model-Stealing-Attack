\section{Introduction}
We run a KnockoffNet attack on a pretrained Resnet50 model trained on the CIFAR dataset with another Resnet50 model but trained on both 
CIFAR and MNIST datasets. We test the new KnockoffNet trained on 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, and 50k queries to the original pretrained model on the 
CIFAR test dataset, MNIST test dataset, and both combined CIFAR and MNIST test dataset to compare the how the different datasets affect the test accuracies.

\section{Results}
The accuracies of the CIFAR test dataset for 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, and 50k queries were 0.137, 0.1154, 0.151, 0.1797, and 0.161, respectively.
For the MNIST and CIFAR dataset it was 0.1984, 0.18735, 0.18895, 0.23545, and 0.21055.
For only MNIST it was 0.189, 0.1795, 0.1488, 0.2127, 0.2185. The table below makes a clearer illustration.

\section{Discussion}
The results were somewhat surprising. Firstly, the accuracies for all test accuracies were very low even for 50k queries.
Secondly, there were no linear trends between number of queries and test accuracies, as the test accuracies would fluctuate throughout
the different query numbers.
\section{Conclusion}
Summarize the key points of your article and discuss possible future research directions.
